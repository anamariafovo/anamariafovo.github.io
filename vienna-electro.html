      <h2 id="marketResearch" class="project-subtitle-electro">
        02. Market Research
      </h2>
      <div class="project-details">
        <h3>
          <b><u>Existing Apps in the Market</u></b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          There are several well-established apps and platforms catering to
          music events and ticketing, though not all focus exclusively on
          electronic and techno concerts. Some of the key players include:
          <b>Songkick, RA (Resident Advisor), Bandsintown, Eventbrite</b>
        </p>
        <span class="separator-line-horizontal"></span>
        <h3>
          <b><u>Trends in the Electronic Music Market</u></b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <b>Techno & Electronic Popularity:</b> Electronic music, especially
          techno, has been on the rise in many global markets, including Vienna.
          Venues like Prater Dome, Grelle Forelle, and SASS Music Club
          frequently host electronic and techno events, indicating a robust
          local demand.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Festival Culture:</b> Many electronic and techno music fans attend
          festivals (e.g., Austrian festivals like Life Ball, Electric Love, or
          the more niche events), and apps that cater to the festival-going
          crowd (with lineups, maps, and ticketing integration) have a distinct
          advantage.
        </p>
        <span class="separator-line-horizontal"></span>
        <h3>
          <b><u>Opportunities and Gaps</u></b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <b>Local Focus:</b> While apps like RA cover events worldwide, a
          hyper-local focus on Vienna, with deep integration into the local
          electronic music scene, could set the app apart. Promoting
          lesser-known venues, underground events, and up-and-coming artists
          could appeal to fans seeking a more intimate experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Mobile-First Design:</b> A mobile-first design with intuitive event
          browsing, map integration (to help users find venues), and
          user-friendly ticketing would ensure ease of use for fans on the go.
        </p>
        <span class="separator-line-horizontal"></span>
        <h3>
          <b><u>Potential Partnerships</u></b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <b>Venue Partnerships:</b> Partnering with popular venues in Vienna
          (such as SASS Music Club or Arena Wien) could help secure exclusive
          content, early-bird ticket offers, or VIP access.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Local DJs and Artists:</b> Building partnerships with Viennaâ€™s
          well-known techno and electronic DJs and promoting their upcoming
          events could boost user engagement and ensure the app stays relevant
          to the local scene.

        <p>
          <b>Music Preferences:</b> Fans of electronic music genres like techno,
          house, trance, dubstep, and minimal, often seeking underground or
          mainstream events.
        </p>
        <h4><b>2. Secondary Users</b></h4>
        <p>
          <b>Event Organizers & Venues:</b> Clubs, promoters, and DJs who need
