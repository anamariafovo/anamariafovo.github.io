        <h3>A music score tablet app for classical musicians</h3>

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section class="project-description">
      <div class="project-overview">
        <h2 class="project-subtitle-musiczone">Overview</h2>
        <p>
          MUSICZONE is an app that helps classical musicians carry all the
          scores they need inside one device. The app has access to a library,
          which allows the user to search and download the music sheet they
          need, as well as a scan tool, which gives the opportunity to scan and
          create a personal library, or upload the scanned sheet to the appâ€™s
          library.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="project-overview">
        <h2 class="project-subtitle-musiczone">The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Classical musicians need to carry multiple music sheets many times
          when they go to rehearsal. Not to forget is that they already need to
          carry their instrument in many cases. This can become very
          uncomfortable when they have a lot of scores to carry around, and it
          can even affect their physical well-being, leading to back problems.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="project-description">
      <div class="project-overview">
        <h2 class="project-subtitle-musiczone">The Solution</h2>
        <p>
          A tablet is much more comfortable to carry around, compared to many
          musical sheets. The focus of this app is to allow access to a library
          that includes many music sheets, which can be downloaded and accessed
          offline, when the user needs to. The option to also scan or import a
          musical score enables the musician to complete their library with any
          score they need. This way, the musician needs to carry around only a
          tablet instead of multiple physical paper sheets with all the notes
          they need.

        Target User Group Questionnaire
      </h4>
      <p>
        I created a list of questions that helped me better understand the needs
        of the targeted user group, the professional classical musicians. The
        outcomes of the first iteration were general ideas regarding what the
        user of this app would need mostly, like a personal library, the scan
        tool, and also the possibility to create a practice list, in order to
        easily access the sheets that are needed for a longer period of time for
        daily practice.
      </p>
      <h4 class="project-subtitle-musiczone">
        Some of these questions include:
      </h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          What features do you think would be most used by musicians in a
          musical sheet app?
        </li>
        <li>
          If you used similar apps, what did you feel was missing from these
          apps?
        </li>
        <li>
          How do you think you could better organize the music sheets in such an
          app?
        </li>
