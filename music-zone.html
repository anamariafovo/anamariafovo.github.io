        <p class="section-description project-paragraph">
          MUSICZONE is an app that helps classical musicians carry all the
          scores they need inside one device. The app has access to a library,
          which allows the user to search and download the music sheet they
          need, as well as a scan tool, which gives the opportunity to scan and
          create a personal library, or upload the scanned sheet to the app’s
          library.

          <h2 class="project-subtitle-music align-center">The Problem</h2>
          <p class="section-description project-paragraph">
            Classical musicians need to carry multiple music sheets many times
            when they go to rehearsal. Not to forget is that they already need
            to carry their instrument in many cases. This can become very
            uncomfortable when they have a lot of scores to carry around, and it
            can even affect their physical well-being, leading to back problems.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-container">
          <h2 class="project-subtitle-music align-center">The Solution</h2>
          <p class="section-description project-paragraph">
            A tablet is much more comfortable to carry around, compared to many
            musical sheets. The focus of this app is to allow access to a
            library that includes many music sheets, which can be downloaded and
            accessed offline, when the user needs to. The option to also scan or
            import a musical score enables the musician to complete their
            library with any score they need. This way, the musician needs to
            carry around only a tablet instead of multiple physical paper sheets
            with all the notes they need.

          I created a list of questions that helped me better understand the
          needs of the targeted user group, the professional classical
          musicians. The outcomes of the first iteration were general ideas
          regarding what the user of this app would need mostly, like a personal
          library, the scan tool, and also the possibility to create a practice
          list, in order to easily access the sheets that are needed for a
          longer period of time for daily practice.
